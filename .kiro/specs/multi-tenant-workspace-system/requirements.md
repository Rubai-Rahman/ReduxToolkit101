# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-tenant task management system with workspace-based organization and role-based access control. The system allows users to manage multiple workspaces, create teams, assign roles, and collaborate on tasks with different permission levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Sync

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate and have my profile automatically synced with the system, so that I can access my workspaces and maintain consistent data across sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger a user sync process
2. WHEN the user sync process runs THEN the system SHALL check if the user exists in the database
3. IF the user doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create a new user record with basic profile information
4. WHEN the user sync completes THEN the system SHALL return user information along with associated workspace data
5. WHEN the sync process fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and allow retry

### Requirement 2: Workspace Selection and Creation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select from my existing workspaces or create a new one during onboarding, so that I can organize my work in separate environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes authentication THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the onboarding/workspace page
2. IF the user has multiple workspaces THEN the system SHALL display a workspace selection interface
3. IF the user has no workspaces THEN the system SHALL prompt them to create their first workspace
4. WHEN a user selects a workspace THEN the system SHALL set it as their active workspace context
5. WHEN a user creates a new workspace THEN the system SHALL automatically assign them as the workspace admin
6. WHEN workspace creation completes THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the main application

### Requirement 3: Multi-Tenant Architecture

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to support multiple isolated workspaces, so that different organizations can use the system without data interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace is created THEN the system SHALL ensure complete data isolation from other workspaces
2. WHEN a user accesses data THEN the system SHALL only return data belonging to their active workspace
3. WHEN performing any operation THEN the system SHALL validate the user has access to the target workspace
4. WHEN switching workspaces THEN the system SHALL update the user's context and refresh all data
5. WHEN a workspace is deleted THEN the system SHALL remove all associated data without affecting other workspaces

### Requirement 4: Role-Based Access Control

**User Story:** As a workspace admin, I want to assign different roles to team members, so that I can control what actions each person can perform within the workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a workspace is created THEN the creator SHALL automatically receive admin role privileges
2. WHEN assigning roles THEN the system SHALL support three role types: Member, Supervisor, and Admin
3. WHEN a user performs an action THEN the system SHALL validate their role permissions before execution
4. WHEN role permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL deny the action and display an appropriate message
5. ONLY admins SHALL be able to change user roles and remove users from the workspace

### Requirement 5: Team Management

**User Story:** As a workspace user with appropriate permissions, I want to create teams and invite people, so that I can organize work groups within my workspace.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has admin or supervisor role THEN they SHALL be able to create new teams
2. WHEN creating a team THEN the system SHALL require a team name and optional description
3. WHEN inviting users THEN the system SHALL send invitation emails with workspace join links
4. WHEN a user accepts an invitation THEN they SHALL be added to the workspace with Member role by default
5. WHEN managing team membership THEN supervisors SHALL be able to add members but not change roles
6. WHEN managing team membership THEN only admins SHALL be able to modify user roles and remove users

### Requirement 6: Task Management with Role Permissions

**User Story:** As a workspace user, I want to create, assign, and manage tasks based on my role permissions, so that I can collaborate effectively with my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has admin role THEN they SHALL be able to create, update, delete, and assign any task
2. WHEN a user has supervisor role THEN they SHALL be able to create, update, delete, and assign tasks
3. WHEN a user has member role THEN they SHALL only be able to update tasks assigned to them
4. WHEN creating a task THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to any team member
5. WHEN a task is assigned THEN the assignee SHALL receive a notification
6. WHEN viewing tasks THEN users SHALL see tasks relevant to their role and assignments
7. WHEN a member updates their assigned task THEN the changes SHALL be visible to supervisors and admins

### Requirement 7: Workspace Administration

**User Story:** As a workspace admin, I want to manage all aspects of my workspace including users, teams, and settings, so that I can maintain control over the work environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin features THEN only users with admin role SHALL have access
2. WHEN managing users THEN admins SHALL be able to view all workspace members and their roles
3. WHEN changing user roles THEN admins SHALL be able to promote/demote between Member, Supervisor, and Admin
4. WHEN removing users THEN admins SHALL be able to remove any user from the workspace
5. WHEN a user is removed THEN all their task assignments SHALL be unassigned and require reassignment
6. WHEN managing workspace settings THEN admins SHALL be able to update workspace name, description, and preferences

### Requirement 8: Data Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want my workspace data to be secure and only accessible to authorized team members, so that I can trust the system with sensitive information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing any data THEN the system SHALL verify the user belongs to the relevant workspace
2. WHEN performing role-restricted actions THEN the system SHALL validate user permissions server-side
3. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use secure protocols and authentication tokens
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL implement proper data isolation between workspaces
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log all significant actions with user and timestamp information
